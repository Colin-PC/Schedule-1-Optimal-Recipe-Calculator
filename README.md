At this moment it only does the calculation for Weed but it can be easily modified to invlude Coke and Meth. 

You specify how many configurations to add and how many optimal configurations to save. 

I have also incldued some of the .txt outputs for weed, those being from adding 1 ingredient all the way to 8 ingredients.

Please not that running more than 6 ingredientss will take a LONG time to load, the 8 ingredient run took about 70 hours to complete. This is because it is a recursive call with an expanding tree branch. You can limit the ingredients to add by selecting a recipe to start with and then only adding 5 additional.
